# CoverageX

CoverageX is a Web 3.0 decentralized web platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform enables 3rd party entities to buy and control their insurance claims for the car(s) that they own in a reliable and secure environment without having to deal with any intermediaries such as banks to process policy claim transactions. One goal of this application is to develop a smart contract for allowing policyholders to create, cancel and renew their policies.
