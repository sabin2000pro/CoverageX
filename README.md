# CoverageX

CoverageX is a proof-of-concept, multi-purpose Web 3.0 decentralized web platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform enables 3rd party entities to buy and control their insurance policy claims for the car(s), and properties that they own in a reliable and secure environment without having to deal with any intermediaries such as banks to process claim transactions. One goal of this application is to develop a smart contract for allowing policyholders to create, cancel and renew their policies. Furthermore, the target audience for this application is individuals acting as policyholder agents that wish to insure their car(s) on a highly secure blockchain, allowing them to securely login into their account, view their currently available policies, change any of them that require modifications, for example, start and end dates. Moreover, policies can also be renewed through the protected dashboard. Since the platform is going to be based upon the Ethereum blockchain, the proof of concept application supports non-fungible token (NFT) functionality for giving the insurance policies transparency and unique ownership, preventing any fraudulent activity.

Every single insurance policy will have a policy number that uniquely identifies it, the type of coverage, comprehensive being the default, start, and end dates as well as information regarding the car that is being insured along with the policyholder which are the end-users on the platform.
